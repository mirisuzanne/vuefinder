**Riding SideSaddle\* is fragmented memory**
written on 250 interchangeable index cards.
Inspired by Margaret Clap and
the myth of Hermaphroditus,
this story follows cast of friends
as they navigate fluid genders,
relationships, and identities –
with bodies that resist order,
category, or completion.

> It’s a new, and wonderful, adventure each time, a story of outcasts, their caretaker, and the friendship and love they find with each other. It’s a story about the body and hybridity — based on the myth of Hermaphroditus — and it’s a story about magic and the slipperiness of categories.

— Ryo Yamaguchi, Michigan Quarterly Review

> One of the most ambitious projects that has come across our desk recently.

— Tim Wenger, Colorado Music Buzz

> A really, really good reading time! Miriam has gathered all of the beauteous, ugly, and necessary parts together in one place. The characters, ideas, story are exposed, raw, alive — merging masculine and feminine into some kind of mystical marriage. Graciously, Miriam leaves us the pleasure of assembly without rules.

— Erin Rollman & Brian Colonna, Buntport Theatre

> This feels more realistic than any other novel could hope to be: every moment is just one in a sea of other moments, no more or less important, although no less interesting for that. The result is an impressionist array of feelings and emotions and understandings of oneself and others.

— Natalie Weizenbaum, Lead Designer/Developer of Sass
